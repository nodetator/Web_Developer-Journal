I re-started the Odin Project about a week ago, I managed to finish the HTML and CSS sections. Not bad. Overall I would give myself a 7/10.

**Positives** 
- Finish HTML & CSS portions
- Consistent practice - I logged Git Commit almost everyday since a week ago, keep it up!

**Negatives**
-d some of the portions of the OdinProject core text too quickly, struggling in the exercise afterwards
- Did not complete CSS exercises or final project of CSS (took more than 5,6 hours on it total, still couldn't finish)
- Weak understanding of CSS overall

**Next Steps**
 - Super excited to start Javascript !!! 
 - Read Javascript text and resources by TOP *VERY SLOWLY*, very important to learn properly
 - Review CSS section on  TOP again (spend 2 hours on all the elements, retry CSS exercises, practice, go on youtube, then retry Landing Page)
 - Write my blog post on the 3 types of learning
 - Frustration is completely normal, just keep logging in the hours
